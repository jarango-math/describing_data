    "1. The mean is 9.857, median is 10.0, mode is 8. Variance is 6.408, standard deviation is 2.734, and standard error is 1.033\n",
    "2. The estimate for the central tendancy would be around 10 and the variance would be around 5. The central tendancy would be around 9.7 since it is near both the mean, median, and mode so this seems like the most likely spot. as for the variance most value are seperated by the mean by a max of 5, so when added together and squared it would make sense that it is around this value\n",
    "3. all values changed except the median, since the change doesn't affect the ordering of the values\n",
    "4. This would not really change the central tendency since the '1' becomes an outlier and would only shift the tendency down a small bit. as for the variance, this would be affect emencely since now we have a value that is extremely far from the mean, meaning the variance would become much higher\n",
    "5. Using the methods similar to the previous problems, we can determine that the central tendency is around .17 or 17% with a standard error of 3%, meaning around 17% of adults were fans of the brady bunch"
